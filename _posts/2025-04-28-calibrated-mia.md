## Introduction

At EMNLP 2024, the [Best Paper Award](https://x.com/emnlpmeeting/status/1857176180128198695/photo/1) was given to **"Pretraining Data Detection for Large Language Models: A Divergence-based Calibration Method"**<d-cite key="zhang2024pretraining"></d-cite>. The paper addresses Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), a key issue in machine learning related to privacy. The authors propose a new calibration method and introduce **PatentMIA**, a benchmark utilizing temporally shifted patent data to validate their approach. The method recalibrates model probabilities using a divergence metric between the outputs of a target model and a token-frequency map (basically a histogram) derived from auxiliary data, claiming improved detection of member and non-member samples.

However, upon closer examination, we identified significant shortcomings in both the experimental design and evaluation methodology. The proposed dataset introduces a temporal shift between the distribution of member and non-member data, which can lead to overestimation of the performance of an MIA that may end up distinguishing samples based on the temporal range, and not actual membership.

In this post, we critically analyze this shift, and the broader implications of MIA evaluations for models in the wild.

## What is Membership Inference?

Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are a useful tool in assessing memorization of training data by a model trained on it. Given a model $$D$$ samples from some underlying distribution $$\mathcal{D}$$ and a model $$M$$ trained on $$D$$, membership inference <d-cite key="yeom2018privacy"></d-cite> asks the following question:

> Was some given record $$x$$ part of the training dataset $$D$$, or just the overall distribution $$\mathcal{D}$$?

The underlying distribution $$\mathcal{D}$$ is assumed to be large enough to the point where the above test can be reframed as inferring whether $$x \in D$$ (via access to $$M$$) or not. In practice, the adversary/auditor starts with some non-member data (data that they know was not part of the training data $$D$$, but belongs to the same underlying distribution $$\mathcal{D}$$) and on the basis of some scoring function, generates a distribution of scores for these non-members. A sweep over these values can then yield "thresholds" corresponding to certain false-positive rates (FPRs), which can then be used to evaluate the true-positive rate (TPR) of the approach under consideration.

It is important to note here that these non-members should be from the **same** underlying distribution. To better understand why this is important, think of a model trained for the binary classification task of distinguishing images of squirrels and groundhogs <d-footnote>Maybe you want to give nuts to squirrels and vegetables to groundhogs </d-footnote>. For this example, let's say this particular groundhog image was part of the training data, but the other two weren't.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/2025-04-28-calibrated-mia/groundhog.avif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/2025-04-28-calibrated-mia/squirrel.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/2025-04-28-calibrated-mia/llama.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

A model will have higher loss on images of llamas, and understandably so since these are images the model did not see at all during training. Using their images would give a clear member/non-member distinction, but would also probably classify *any* squirrel/groundhog image as a member, even if it wasn't. As an experimental setup, this is easily enforced when working with standard machine learning models and datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, where well-established train/test splits from the same underlying distribution exist.

### What's Special about LLMs?

Because these models are trained on a large scale of data (and in many cases, exact training data is unknown), it is hard to collect data to use as "non-members" which has not been used in the model training **and** is from the same underlying distribution. Early works on membership inference for LLMs resorted to using data generated after a model's training cutoff <d-cite key="shi2023detecting"></d-cite>, since such data could not have been seen by a model. However, such design choices can introduce implicit distribution shifts <d-cite key="das2024blind,duan2024membership,maini2024llm,meeus2024sok"></d-cite> and give a false sense of membership leakage.

## Method Overview  

The proposed method tries to fix a known issue with MIAs: models often fail to properly separate member and non-member samples. To address this, the authors use an auxiliary data-source to compute token-level frequencies, which are then used to recalibrate token-wise model logits. This normalization aims to adjust token-level model probabilities based on their natural frequency or rarity, aligning with membership inference practices such as reference model calibration<d-cite key="carlini2022membership"></d-cite>.

They also introduce **PatentMIA**, a benchmark that uses temporally shifted patents as data. The idea is to test whether the model can identify if a patent document was part of its training data or not. While this approach sounds interesting, our experiments suggest that the reported results are influenced by limitations in the benchmark design.

## Experimental Evaluation  

We ran two key experiments to test the paper's claims: one for true positives and another for false positives.  

### True Positive Rate Experiment  

This experiment checks if the method can correctly distinguish member data from non-member data when both are drawn from the **same distribution**.
We used train and validation splits from **The Pile** dataset, which ensures there are no temporal or distributional differences between the two sets.
Below we report results for the *Wikipedia* split.

| Model              | AUC | TPR@5%FPR |
| :---------------- | :---------: | ----: |
| [Pythia-6.9B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/pythia-6.9b) |   0.542 | 0.071 |
| [GPT-Neo-125M](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m) | 0.492 | 0.054 |
| [GPT-NeoX-20B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b) | 0.600 | 0.103 |

**Result:**  
The method performs only slightly better than the LOSS attack, and remains comparable to most standalone membership inference attacks. For reference, AUC with the baseline LOSS and zlib <d-cite key="carlini2021extracting"></d-cite> attacks for Pythia-6.9B are 0.526 and 0.536 respectively, while it is 0.618 when using a reference-model (Table 12 in <d-cite key="duan2024membership"></d-cite>). Similarly, using LOSS and zlib yield AUCs of 0.563 and 0.572 respectively.

Reported improvements in the paper (Table 2 <d-cite key="zhang2024pretraining"></d-cite> showing AUCs of 0.7 and higher) are thus <u>likely due to exploiting differences in the data distribution</u>, rather than actual improvements in detecting membership.  

### False Positive Rate Experiment  

Next, we check how often the method falsely identifies data as "member" when it has in fact not be used in the model's training. To do this, we use the **WikiMIA**<d-cite key="shi2023detecting"></d-cite> dataset but replaced the training data with unrelated validation data from the *Wikipedia* split of **The Pile**. This means that we can say with certainty that the Pythia and GPT-neox models did not train on either split. We follow the experimental setup of in Section 3 of <d-cite key="maini2024llm"></d-cite> for this analysis.

**Result:**  
Below we report results for the *Wikipedia* split. Note that in this setting, a score closer to 0.5 is better since both splits are non-members.

| Model              | AUC for DC-PDD <d-cite key="zhang2024pretraining"></d-cite> | AUC for LOSS <d-cite key="carlini2021extracting"></d-cite> |
| :---------------- | :---------: | ----: |
| [Pythia-6.9B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/pythia-6.9b) |   0.667 | 0.636 |
| [GPT-Neo-125M](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m) | 0.689 | 0.671 |
| [GPT-Neox-20b](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b) | 0.637 | 0.656 |


The method flags a high number of false positives. It frequently identifies non-member data as part of the training set, suggesting that the attack was was reliant on temporal or distribution artifacts rather than truly detecting membership.

## The Problem with Temporally Shifted Benchmarks  

The introduction of **PatentMIA** highlights a broader problem with MIA research: benchmarks that rely on temporal shifts <d-cite key="meeus2024did,shi2023detecting,dubinski2024towards,ko2023practical"></d-cite>. These benchmarks often make it easy for attack models to exploit simple artifacts, like whether a document contains terms that didnâ€™t exist during training (e.g., "COVID-19" or "Tesla Model Y"). This creates an illusion of success but doesnâ€™t address the real challenge of membership inference.  

### Why These Benchmarks Are Misleading  

The issues with temporally shifted benchmarks are not new. Several prior works have already established the dangers of using such benchmarks:  

1. **Spurious Patterns**: Temporal shifts introduce artifacts that are easily exploitable by attack models. As noted by Duan et al. <d-cite key="duan2024membership"></d-cite>, temporal markers (e.g., "COVID-19" or recent events) allow models to cheat by detecting new concepts rather than true membership.  
2. **Misleading Evaluations**: Maini et al. <d-cite key="maini2024llm"></d-cite> show how temporal shifts can inflate the perceived success of MIAs, even when no meaningful membership inference occurs.  
3. **Blind Baselines Work Better**: Das et al. <d-cite key="das2024blind"></d-cite> demonstrate that blind baselines often outperform sophisticated MIAs on temporally shifted datasets, highlighting how these benchmarks fail to test real inference ability.  

Despite these well-established issues, the EMNLP Best Paper continues to rely on temporally shifted data like **PatentMIA** for its evaluations. This undermines the robustness of its claims and contributes little to advancing membership inference research.

## Machine Learning Awards: A Problem of Incentives  

This situation raises important questions about the role of awards in machine learning research.  

1. **Do Awards Encourage Rushed Work?** Highlighting work with known flaws, like relying on misleading benchmarks, can discourage researchers from investing time in more rigorous evaluations.  
2. **Harming the Field**: Awards that celebrate flawed work set a bad precedent and can mislead the community into thinking these methods are the gold standard.  
3. **Losing Credibility**: Over time, the reputation of awards themselves suffers, as researchers may start viewing them as less meaningful.  

This is a growing problem in machine learning research, where not only acceptance but even awards are constantly under [scrutiny](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/w4ooph/d_icml_2022_outstanding_paper_awards/) for their [soundness](https://parameterfree.com/2023/08/30/yet-another-icml-award-fiasco/), let alone their contribution. If awards are to truly highlight excellence, they must emphasize thoroughness, reproducibility, and robustness over surface-level novelty.

## Conclusion  

The EMNLP 2024 Best Paper sought to address a pressing challenge in membership inference but falls short under careful scrutiny. The proposed method fails both in distinguishing members and non-members under rigorous conditions and in avoiding false positives when the data is untrained. Furthermore, its reliance on **PatentMIA** exemplifies a larger issue with using temporally shifted benchmarks to claim progress.  

For the field to advance meaningfully, greater emphasis must be placed on rigorous evaluation practices. Awards should reflect this by rewarding work with robust and thorough evaluations, rather than methods that (knowingly or otherwise) exploit well-known flaws in evaluation practices. Only then can we ensure that the field moves forward in a meaningful way.
