## Equations




## Images and Figures

Its generally a better idea to avoid linking to images hosted elsewhere - links can break and you
might face losing important information in your blog post.
To include images in your submission in this way, you must do something like the following:

```markdown
{% raw %}{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/iclr.png" class="img-fluid" %}{% endraw %}
```

which results in the following image:

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/iclr.png" class="img-fluid" %}

To ensure that there are no namespace conflicts, you must save your asset to your unique directory
`/assets/img/2025-04-28-[SUBMISSION NAME]` within your submission.

Please avoid using the direct markdown method of embedding images; they may not be properly resized.
Some more complex ways to load images (note the different styles of the shapes/shadows):

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/8.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-2" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/10.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-2" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/11.jpg" class="img-fluid"  %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/12.jpg" class="img-fluid" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/7.jpg" class="img-fluid" %}
    </div>
