  abstract  ={Robots' use of natural language is one of the key factors that
               leads humans to anthropomorphize them. But it is not yet well
               understood what types of language most lead to such
               language-based anthropomorphization (or, Linguistic
               Anthropomorphism). In this paper, we present a brief literature
               survey that suggests six broad categories of linguistic factors
               that lead humans to anthropomorphize robots: autonomy,
               adaptability, directness, politeness, proportionality, and humor.
               By contextualizing these six factors through the lens of Jackson
               and Williams' Theory of Social Agency for Human-Robot
               Interaction, we are able to show how and why these particular
               factors are those responsible for language-based robot
               anthropomorphism.},
