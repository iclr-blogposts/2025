               leads humans to anthropomorphize them. But it is not yet well
               understood what types of language most lead to such
               language-based anthropomorphization (or, Linguistic
               Anthropomorphism). In this paper, we present a brief literature
               survey that suggests six broad categories of linguistic factors
               that lead humans to anthropomorphize robots: autonomy,
               adaptability, directness, politeness, proportionality, and humor.
               By contextualizing these six factors through the lens of Jackson
               and Williams' Theory of Social Agency for Human-Robot
               Interaction, we are able to show how and why these particular
               factors are those responsible for language-based robot
               anthropomorphism.},

              conversations, including the expression of human emotions with
              such utterances as “I am sorry…”, “I hope you enjoy…”, “I am
              grateful…”, or “I regret that…”. By 2021, digital assistants will
              outnumber humans. No one seems to stop to ask if creating more
              digital companions that appear increasingly human is really
              beneficial to the future of our species. In this essay, we pose
              the question: “How human should computer-based human-likeness
              appear?” We rely on the philosophy of humanness and the theory of
              speech acts to consider the long-term consequences of living with
              digital creatures that express human-like feelings. We argue that
              feelings are the very substance of our humanness and therefore are

The best-performing GPT-4 prompt passed in 49.7{\%} of games, outperforming ELIZA (22{\%}) and GPT-3.5 (20{\%}), but falling short of the baseline set by human participants (66{\%}). Participants{'} decisions were based mainly on linguistic style (35{\%}) and socioemotional traits (27{\%}), supporting the idea that intelligence, narrowly conceived, is not sufficient to pass the Turing test. Participant knowledge about LLMs and number of games played positively correlated with accuracy in detecting AI, suggesting learning and practice as possible strategies to mitigate deception. Despite known limitations as a test of intelligence, we argue that the Turing test continues to be relevant as an assessment of naturalistic communication and deception. AI models with the ability to masquerade as humans could have widespread societal consequences, and we analyse the effectiveness of different strategies and criteria for judging humanlikeness.},

                   Measurement and Mitigation},
  author        ={Chien, Jennifer and Danks, David},
  journal       ={arXiv [cs.CY]},
  abstract      ={Algorithmic harms are commonly categorized as either
                   allocative or representational. This study specifically
                   addresses the latter, focusing on an examination of current
                   definitions of representational harms to discern what is
                   included and what is not. This analysis motivates our
                   expansion beyond behavioral definitions to encompass harms to
                   cognitive and affective states. The paper outlines high-level
                   requirements for measurement: identifying the necessary
                   expertise to implement this approach and illustrating it
                   through a case study. Our work highlights the unique
                   vulnerabilities of large language models to perpetrating
                   representational harms, particularly when these harms go
                   unmeasured and unmitigated. The work concludes by presenting
                   proposed mitigations and delineating when to employ them. The
                   overarching aim of this research is to establish a framework
                   for broadening the definition of representational harms and
                   to translate insights from fairness research into practical
                   measurement and mitigation praxis.},

  abstract  ={With the continuous improvement of large language models (LLMs),
               chatbots can produce coherent and continuous word sequences that
               mirror natural human language. While the use of natural language
               and human-like conversation styles enables the use of chatbots
               within a range of everyday settings, these usability-enhancing
               features can also have unintended consequences, such as making
               fallible information seem trustworthy by emphasizing friendliness
               and closeness. This can have serious implications for information
               retrieval tasks performed with chatbots. In this paper, we
               provide an overview of the literature on parasociality, social
               affordance, and trust to bridge these concepts within human-AI
               interactions. We critically examine how chatbot “roleplaying” and
               user role projection co-produce a pseudo-interactive,
               technologically-mediated space with imbalanced dynamics between
               users and chatbots. Based on the review of the literature, we
               develop a conceptual framework of parasociality in chatbots that
               describes interactions between humans and anthropomorphized
               chatbots. We dissect how chatbots use personal pronouns,
               conversational conventions, affirmations, and similar strategies
               to position the chatbots as users’ companions or assistants, and
               how these tactics induce trust-forming behaviors in users.
               Finally, based on the conceptual framework, we outline a set of
               ethical concerns that emerge from parasociality, including
               illusions of reciprocal engagement, task misalignment, and leaks
               of sensitive information. This paper argues that these possible
               consequences arise from a positive feedback cycle wherein
               anthropomorphized chatbot features encourage users to fill in the
               context around predictive outcomes.},

    abstract ={Anthropomorphism, or the attribution of human-like characteristics to non-human entities, has shaped conversations about the impacts and possibilities of technology. We present AnthroScore, an automatic metric of implicit anthropomorphism in language. We use a masked language model to quantify how non-human entities are implicitly framed as human by the surrounding context. We show that AnthroScore corresponds with human judgments of anthropomorphism and dimensions of anthropomorphism described in social science literature. Motivated by concerns of misleading anthropomorphism in computer science discourse, we use AnthroScore to analyze 15 years of research papers and downstream news articles. In research papers, we find that anthropomorphism has steadily increased over time, and that papers related to language models have the most anthropomorphism. Within ACL papers, temporal increases in anthropomorphism are correlated with key neural advancements. Building upon concerns of scientific misinformation in mass media, we identify higher levels of anthropomorphism in news headlines compared to the research papers they cite. Since AnthroScore is lexicon-free, it can be directly applied to a wide range of text sources.},

  abstract  ={Chatbots are a burgeoning opportunity for news media outlets to
               disseminate their content in a conversational way, and create an
               engaging experience around it. Since chatbots are social and
               interactive technologies, they might be effective tools to lower
               the threshold of engaging with news content containing opposing
               views. In an experiment, we test this idea by investigating
               whether people are more likely to accept a news article
               containing conflicting views when it is delivered by a chatbot,
               as compared with the same article on a news website. The results
               indicated that people agreed more to a counter-attitudinal news
               article when it was delivered by a news chatbot (compared with
               the website article). In addition, users also perceived this
               chatbot article as more credible. The underlying process for this
               effect was that people attributed human-like characteristics to
               the chatbot on an implicit level (i.e., perceived mindless
               anthropomorphism). These results are discussed in the light of
               their potential contribution to an informed public discourse and
               a decrease in polarization in our society.},
